Some have it easy,

Some always get the short straw,

Some take everything in their stride, come what may

The more, the scars of battle's

The fiercer one moulds from the will of fire

Sculpting a sword while striking a hot anvil,

Anyone can try & accomplish

But striking the raw iron, Day in , Day Out ,

To make it a supernova.

Legends never had it easy.

For only the heart of steel,

Can hold the fire of Brilliant Sun
