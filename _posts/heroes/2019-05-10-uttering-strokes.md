A Picture conveys a 1000 words, they say

Make that 100,000 words in your case ,

To sketch with abandon and abundance

takes decades to draw like a child

says the master Picasso

We are all created in the image of God,

Rarely few continue using the magic in them

No riches, No wealth, No amount of Blood,

Can withstand the test of time like Art,

Fortunate are those, who could glimpse

A hundredth of the magic in Your Art

Keep the fingers flowing withe pencil,

For the river nourishes,

All that comes in its path,

And for All Eternity,

Its Warmth & Glory

Shall be Cherished
