The Majesty of Mona Lisa's Smile

The Spezzatura of Raphael's Work

The All Seeing Eye of the Eagle, Collecting Life's Brilliant Moments,

Only a Queen can make another Queen,

Only the Oracle could name the treasure, A Treasure

Only this Treasure is not hidden, for the seekers to find  after Millenia

Here we have a living Goddess

Illuminating the compass,

The Brightest North star
