There will always be hope

The world has its very own superheroes

finding Clark Kent

Today i saw my friend online at 5.30 am

When i asked if she is preparing for Exams

Fortunately i was wrong

She is helping other students for their exams

Her online class starts at 6.15 to make up time difference of 4.30 hrs.

She is helping 8th std students learn science

This is the inspiration that Trusha Adeshara inspires by leading the way

I just keeping posting online

And there is her. Making the actual difference.

If u also want to be a role model and inspiration like her

eVidyaloka is the place to start.

One person can make the difference
