Like the Chirping of Birds,

Is a Sign of a Happy Morning,

Like the sound of Waterfall,

Gladdens & fill hope to a Thirsty Soul

Your melodious Voice

Lifts the Heart

Of the Weary Traveller

Like the Nectar to the Bee

Sing out your Heart Always

For the magic is Strong in You

Your fire will Shine as the

Light Tower in Dark Sea
