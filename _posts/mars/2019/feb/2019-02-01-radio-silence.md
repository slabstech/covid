To achieve greatness,

Sacrifice of mortal things is crucial.

Reducing my sphere of communication, to only email based. Reduces the anxiety
of missing out on something & heps to increase focus towards inner peace.

With my main goal of flying to mars and setting up infrastructure for human
settlement. Focus is paramount and sacrifice is necessary. I need to practice
the environment and conditions that will be waiting for me on mars.

As they said : Sweat in practice, so that you dont bleed in battle.


Starting today, 1st Feb 2019, im logging off WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,
till i build my core inner strength, i cannot allow distractions from my goal. Anything
other than the goal is insignificant.

All my learning and self-analysis would be regularly updated on the blog, there is also
an Android App on the way, it will provide updates and will be the single source of information
for all my activities. Allowing me to build one good platform .

Continuing Gandhi's vow of silence, i plan to continue to observe the penance for next one week.
My first one day salvo, i did observe changes, by reducing speech, i was able to provide more
focus on the sense of vision and hearing.


Any penance with understanding the scriptures is akin to walking in a forest without any guidance.
Bhagavad Gita is my current companion. It will help me revisit the age old journey of all the
previous masters who undertook a similar journey. Hopefully it will provide some insights to solve
my ever increasing questions of the meaning of life.

To become a gaganyatri, body and mind are one .

Quoting the Bhagavad Gita

When your conviction of a truth is not mearly in your brain but in your being, you may
diffidently vouch for its meaning.
