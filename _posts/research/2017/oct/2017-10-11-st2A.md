# Structural Stability Analyzer

Anaylyze the stability of building/construction sites using 3D models

## Steps
	1. Using drones analyze buildings for cracks.
	2. Use tools to determine strength/stability of buldings
	(Similar tech is used to mobile tower maintenance).

## Modules
  1. Image Processing
  2. PointCloud
  3. CAD tools
