Few Observations for Research

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

## Dataset Download
	While using any public dataset, collect information regarding : 
		1. Size of Dataset, 
		2. No. of paper citations ( Usage of Dataset) 
		3. State of the art algorithms,
		4. Constraints of the data
		5. Errors Identified with data

## Literature Survey
	Collect following information for chosen domain
		1. Top 10 - Conferences  - Also their acceptance criteria and Deadlines
		2. Top Journals for domain
		3. State of The Art Papers in the domain/ related
		4. Initial Paper/Discovery which led to the domain
		5. Challenges faced in each paper
		6. Dataset used for the paper
		7. Open Issues and Future work of paper


## Calculations

	accuracy = (correctly predicted class / total testing class) Ã— 100%

	The accuracy can be defined as the percentage of correctly classified instances (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). where TP, FN, FP and TN represent the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives and true negatives, respectively.
	also you can use standard performance measures:

	1. Sensitivity = TP / TP + FN
	2. Specificity = TN / TN + FP
	3. Precision = TP / TP + FP
	4. True-Positive Rate = TP / TP + FN
	5. False-Positive Rate = FP / FP + TN
	6. True-Negative Rate = TN / TN + FP
	7. False-Negative Rate = FN / FN + TP
