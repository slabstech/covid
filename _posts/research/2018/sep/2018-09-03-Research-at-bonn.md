Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS) at Uni-Bonn. [AIS](http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/research.html)

Current Research Project
1. Humanoid Soccer Robots
2. Service Robots
3. Bin Picking
4. Micro Aerial Vehicles
5. Exploration Robot
6. Deep Learning

Humanoid Soccer Robots (Nimbro) looks enticing to work on.  Intention is to work on cyberphysical systems. Last 4-5 years working in the Software industry, there
is no spark/enchanting things to work on. Will increase my horizon by working on
hardware and try to get hands dirty as a grease monkey for the robots.

To prove my worth and to make a compelling request, there are 2 open source projects
maintained by PhD grads at IAS.  https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/humanoid_op_ros and
https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/nimbro_network. Have to become updated with ROS by the time i reach Bonn.
