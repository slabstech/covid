01, Feb 2019 update

Have chosen only robotics stream for this semester.
* Cognitive Robotics Lecture
* Cognitive Robotics Lab
* Cognitive Robotics Seminar
* Humanoid Robots Lab


According to the module handbook from Informatik at University of Bonn.

There are 4 tracks to choose course for the first three semesters and a Master thesis for the final semester.

The Four tracks are mentioned below
1. Algorithms
2. Graphics, Vision, Audio
3. Information and Communication Management
4. Intelligent Systems


Research areas at AIS .

1. Project CENTAURO [link](http://www.centauro-project.eu/)
2. Anticipating Human Behavior[link1](http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/projects/project_FOR_2535_P7.html) [link2](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/FOR2535/#/start)


A total of 120 credits have to be completed for the Master's Course.
Around 30 credits per semester is the average followed by most students.

Total 120. 88(subjects)+32(thesis) , U can take more than 88 in subjects. Thank you Kainaat for correcting my earlier mistake of credits required.
