Abstract â€”
Present day mobile phones have evolved as multimedia devices, where users can capture and store photos, videos on
their mobile phones.
As the amount of digital multimedia content expands, it becomes increasingly difficult to find specific images in  the  device,  giving  rise  to  problems  of  organization,  storing and  retrieval  of  images.  
To  improve  human  access  to  a  large unstructured data in their personal collections on mobile phones, there  is  a  need  for  effective  and  precise  retrieval  algorithms  for the  user  to  search  browse  and  interact  with  these  collections in  real  time.  
Retrieval  algorithms  are  highly  complex  and  this characteristic  becomes  more  intense  on  mobile  platform  due  to restrictions  in  architecture  and  computing  power.  

In  this  paper we propose a speech based image retrieval algorithm for personal collections  optimized  for  porting  on  to  a  mobile  phones.  We have  treated  the  speech  spectrogram  as  an  image  and  applied trace  transformation  to  obtain  an  unique  and  robust  identifier string that acts as a fingerprint for image retrieval systems.

Trace transform is popular in image processing algorithms because it is robust to affine transforms for feature extraction. The proposed algorithm  exhibits  optimization  in  memory  and  retrieval  time costs.
