During a literary fest, a red dot was moving around the head of the author. Thinking that it was some kid playing with laser's. I tried to block it with a book.

In a few seconds, i could see the outline of a someone holding a gun and pointing towards me in the shadow.

Slowly i moved out from the place and shifted to another corner, when i immediately heard a gun shot. I saw that people were around the old seat i had occupied some time ago.

Someone had targeted me and i was scared out of my wits. I could then see armed guards moving from each row doing checks on the people in front of me.

When they arrived at my row, they seemed to linger more time at my location and i started thinking that something was going totally wrong.
