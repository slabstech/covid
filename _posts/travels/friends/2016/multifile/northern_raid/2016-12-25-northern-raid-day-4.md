## Story of the expedition

This trek was in the pipeline for a long time,  trying to fit in other places around this time.

Reading blog posts and some amazing photography, we were hooked in and hell bent to finish it at all cost. The major attraction would be the snow covered Mountain's

The duration of the expedition was six days,  with the actual trek being three days. Initially we were disappointed as there was no snow in sight and wasn't predicted for some time in the future.

Christmas came with magic and our prayers are answered,  hoho Santa had brought snow as our gift.

Usually the trek with snow would be on the roads completely,  we had lady luck riding with us,  we were treated to ample snow on day one of our trek from Dalhousie to kalatop ,  day two was through lush jungle of the kalatop -khajjiar wild life sanctuary and on the third day it was amid the watchful eyes of the sun blazing in full glory.  All in all we had three different climate conditions during the duration of the trek.

Our group DW-14, had 44 eager participants coming from all walks of life,  majority was of first timers while there were also veterans of 10+ treks under their belt.

Day 1 was for reporting and settling into the base camp,  we were given a few instructions on do's and donts for the duration of the trek.
