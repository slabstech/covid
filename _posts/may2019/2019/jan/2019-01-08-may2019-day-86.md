#### Ignorance

for all these years , i've been ignorant and 

selfish about my personal needs


I used to cry hoarse when i had to 
pay nearly a month's salary 

as income tax at the end of the year.


I used to be angry 
when the roads would be destroyed 
after just one rain.


All i did was get angry, 
curse someone and 
then get on with my life.


This is what we have been told to do 
since a school days,


Always follow what the teacher says,

u have no right to question them.


This is the reason for our country to be looted 

year after year

election after election

Election promises, 
remained as promises.

Which was recycled 
when the politician came to ask 
for votes the next time.


There was no one to question the authority,

But in today's world, 

u have the means to ask your questions.

For once,

 use social media 

##### voice your opinions

Do not get into fights 

but raise your voice 

when u see a greater ideal 

being thrown away for the 

sake of money and fame
