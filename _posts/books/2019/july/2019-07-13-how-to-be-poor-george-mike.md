To make morality prevail needs a certain amount of courage

* You must be brave enough not to be uncouth among the uncouth

* You must be brave enough not to be proud of being uneducated

* You must go as far as not to use foul language

* You must be brave enough to be courteous

* You must face the derisive laughter of the crowd, should you offer your seat in a bus to a crippled & blind lady of 92

* You must be brave enough not to push, not to jump queues, not to elbow people aside, not to smoke cannabis, even if everybody around you does

* Not to get drunk when all your friends do, not to admire drunken driving as an act of heroism

* You must be brave enough to pay your bills, to treat all people, whether they are dukes or paupers with courtesy & as your equals (never mind the rank or your own)

* You must be brave enough - to face the howling hordes of your own people, whether they call u blocky, a union-basher, a nigger-lover, a traitor to your own class and follow the dictate of your conscience

The overwhelming majority of these seemingly indomitable people who march under banners and shout slogans are pitiable cowards; the man who walks alone is the brave man


Amazing writing from George Mike
