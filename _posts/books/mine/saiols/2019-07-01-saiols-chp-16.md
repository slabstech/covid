They say "You will only know the value of something, when u lose it".

A few years ago, around 23 year timeframe, these lines were repeated during a eye testing campaign at the college.

The ophthalmologist uttered these words during the keynote speech at the college.
He wondered now, why did i not learn the meaning in youth.

He wouldn't have imagined these words would come to haunt him later.

Taking her for granted was a mistake that he never forgives himself, though the signs were apparent from her
that he wasnt the same as he said he was in the beginning.

One day,She just left silently .

The shock still resonates when he hears her name being called, somewhere secretly the hearts wishes
to see them eyes again .

Hopefully the lesson was learnt.
