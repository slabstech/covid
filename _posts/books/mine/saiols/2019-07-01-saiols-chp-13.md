Those were the days of the early android phone, With an OK simple camera,
To send a photo to each other, one had to twist and turn, Like a yoga pose to get a right photo Or find a mirror to be in the same photo.

We had a photos of each other, sneakily picked up from old albums and functions. It almost took a year, to have a picture of us together. It was considered strange to ask someone to take a picture in the city without any monuments and also not to attract unwanted attention.

The naval base museum was the first photo shoot we had, till now there is only that single picture of us standing together under the propeller of the old navy plane.
