Staying back at the stop,

waiting for nothing and no-one in particular

Time would dissolve in the conversations

From our deepest fears, to your ever growing admirers list

To our castle of future dreams,

There was always something left at the end of the day.

Waiting eagerly for the next time to come over soon
