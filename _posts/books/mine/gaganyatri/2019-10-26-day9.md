During school, being an astronaut was considered cool.
I would sometimes sketch robots, simply adding more pods/thrusters. Then there was the swat-kats
fighter plane that would literally do anything.

I wanted to create something like the plane, with my own attentiveness to blame,
i've drifted away towards other pursuits, none which were actually under my control to acquire.

Now after all these years, life has presented opportunities to fulfil them again.

Resources are available, only self-discipline and application is necessary to create the day dreams into
actual sculpture. Willing to accomplish and pursue life with more vigour and persistence for this is the only one
way to get closer to the stars above.
