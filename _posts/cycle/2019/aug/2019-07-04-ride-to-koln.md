* Clear wavy roads, some crumbling on the way to wake up from the straight line rides

* Crossing meadows, man-made islands, animal shelters, gravelled roads

* Good for the heart to nestle among the green rumbling leaves, connecting the to its distant past of the early wanderers

* One loses, sense of time, slowly meandering some where, pedalling across paths unseen, unknown.

* The idyllic nature, forging its way in its own pace slowly, but surely touching and conquering all that comes in its way


* The Path  

  * Pivot at Wesseling to Bruhl,  ride on the RB48 back

  * 90 mins ride to Bruhl along the watery rhine, on the mystery machine
