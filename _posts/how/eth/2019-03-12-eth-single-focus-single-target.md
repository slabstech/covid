Your only target ETH.

To learn and understand under the tutelage of Dr. Raffaello D'Andrea [bio](https://raffaello.name/) .
His TedTalks [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ) has been the great influence to study and create robots.

16 mins of pure magic when the application of mathematics, science and technology created wonder with the aerial drones.

Now many lakhs of students have seen the video,

thousands more are inspired by it

and few hundred in the world are serious to do anything about

and would be applying for studies at ETH.
