Gazebo Developers Tool

* List of prerequisites: Linux, mercurial, software design, docker
* Description of programming skills: python (medium-high level)
* Difficulty level: Medium
* List of potential mentors: Jose Luis Rivero
* Detailed description: The project consists on the creation of a command line utility that allows Gazebo/Developers and users and easy access to a working environment for developing Gazebo (a complex application with many dependencies, different supported versions in different platforms, interactions with other frameworks, use of GPU, ...). The idea would be to use virtualization (docker) to provide to the user a ready to go environment for developing or testing.
