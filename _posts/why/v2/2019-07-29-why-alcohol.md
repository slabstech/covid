* Its Mostly used as feel good hallucinogen due to oxidation

* Would make sense to forget trauma & numb physical pain and also a disinfectant

* But what baffles me, is the logic behind celebratory events raising toasts

* Why drink & forget an achievement, is it because that others invited are in pain of something or someone and need a drink to get sloshed and forget everything

* Whoever remembers a heavy drinking night, most the times it leads to nuisance & irreparable mistakes

* An unsolvable mystery of the world, just like a knife's usefulness depends if its in the hands of a butcher or a surgeon
