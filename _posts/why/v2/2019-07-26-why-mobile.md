Mobiles , Bane and Boon

Now that 10 days countdown is complete, time to switch of the over-communicator device for good(till the next countdown cycle).

Personally for me it
* Aggravates my ADHD : cannot be distracted and lose sight of the watchtower in the dark, rough seas of life

*  No silent contemplation : its a rabbit hole, draining time and energy as the mind takes of tangentially at all times to avoid any constructive and productive work.

* Nobel Prize : need to concentrate on pure research to have a shot at the Nobel Prize for physics, no prizes but a ticket to mental asylum for high consumption of mobile.

Should i continue using mobiles ?

Would You ?
