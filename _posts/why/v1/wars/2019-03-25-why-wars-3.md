We all remember the Taj Mahal as the epitome sign of Love of Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz

We also know that the labourers and artists that actually built the monument, had their hands cut off

Shah Jahan justified this gruesome act as a prohibition that no other similar monument could be built

Yes, the Taj Mahal is epitome of Architecture.

But why dont we condemn the lives lost

when the bread earning member loses his hands

what happened to the families

how did the families support the catastrophic

should we still call the Taj Mahal as the symbol of love

I wont ,
