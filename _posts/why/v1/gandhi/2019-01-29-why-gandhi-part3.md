Gandhi dharma

It's 71 years, since

MGK

became immortal as

Mahatma

Our freedom did not come easily


When Gandhi's

3 monkey

Turned to

Stop -  who speak evil

Stop - who do evil

Stop - no longer tolerate to see evil


When
Live and let live


Mother earth has enough for our needs

Dont let greed manifest again as evil

Our children

and next generations will judge

us

Be responsible
