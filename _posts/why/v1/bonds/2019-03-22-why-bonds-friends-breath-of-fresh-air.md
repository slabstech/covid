Its the breath of new fresh air of the coming spring

Bringing the cool and warm breeze from for away

The corrections in broken Hindi

The in-numerous questions

The contagious laughter

The fights over the dinner playlist : I still haven't been able to listen to Afreen Afreen completely once this last 10 days

There is still hope

There is a beautiful world out there

Gotta protect the flickering flame

As they say, if you look keenly you will even find god

Its like pampering my kid sister

Hopefully she will also get all the help she need

(Leveraging Karma :P)

Cheers to new friendships

Cheers to renewed old friendships
