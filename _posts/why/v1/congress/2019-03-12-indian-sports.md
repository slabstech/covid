USA's top sports award is named after their most famous and amazing runner .

USA tops the Olympic Gold Medal List, now its being given competition by our might neighbors China

India's top sports award is named after someone who did not win any sports medal at major competition

Indian athletes struggle to compete at Olympic Levels due to lack of sports infrastructure . but we still have the athletes who have made the nation proud

Indian was ruthless and uttlerly dominating during the reign of Dhyan Chand .

Why did it stop winning ?

When was the last time you saw an open playground with good facilities.

With the Khelo India school game competition, India is making the necessary changes to start the gold rush .

I remember Modi's speech at KLE Belgaum centenary celebrations, that he wanted atleast 5 gold medals from the KLE Society students.
