The pot of gold is hidden at the end of rainbow

How is the rainbow formed, it is created in our eyes

Processed by our brain, shouldn't it be easy now ?

Listen to what is not being told,

Read between the lines,

Project the future in our minds

Wonder, why they go to nature, to find their pure nature
