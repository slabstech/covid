9th month from Hubli  

* Today marks the completion of 9 months of my departure from Hubli,
  * the place that i grew up in,
  * studied till grad,
  * fell in love-with,
  * scrapped skin falling over multiple times

This is how, the one place that has built me from the ground up.

* Studied till matriculation in the illustrious & notorious St Mary's School.
  * All boys school,
  * freedom of expression,
  * Courage & Resilience was strengthened there every day.
  * Surviving the pit of fire
  * The brightest diamonds are the outcome of the highest pressure.

* Equality, Poverty, Vanity, Smartness, Sloppiness everything was available in abundance.

It was choosing the best & valid option that would be understood by a teenage mind
