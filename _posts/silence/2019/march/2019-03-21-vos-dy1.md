Today, the 21st March 2019. Marks the completion of 5th month (moon cycle) of my arrival in Bonn .

I have come here with a vision to be the first person to step foot on mars .

I have to become

  * Physically strong to survive and create in harsh environments

  * Mentally capable to find solutions in distress and be at peace always

  * Technically have depth of knowledge to take right actions


There are 2 ways to reach Mars now

* Aboard the ISRO Mangalyaan 2 mission

* Aboard SpaceX Starship Mars exploration mission


Now i have taken strides to become physically strong and mentally capable in the new German environment

From today. i start afresh with single minded focus on the 3rd aspect of technical knowledge and dissemination into robotics
