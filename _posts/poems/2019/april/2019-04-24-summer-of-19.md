white shores await

the soul searching traveler

the constant waves

washing everything away

reminding one that

everything here is temporary

time always gets

its wish

the weary traveler scribbles

the insignificant observations

hope fills him to last longer

like a bottled ship

reaching distant lands

eons away

creating wonder for the seeker
