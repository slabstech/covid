#### Memories


Not even time could heal,

      for memories never diminished


Your presence,

     always bring sweet thoughts onto me

So close were we,

     sharing our thoughts and dreams alike,


A knot resides at the place,

     where you used to live before


Feels so desolate,

     without you around.


Just a look in your eyes,

     would convey so many thoughts


So bad is the craving,

      to see the eyes , words just cant say


Deep as a rift,

    have things turned out between us


Would do anything,

     to undo the mistakes


Chances are that you may forget,

    it'll never be the case with me


Silence was,

     the best part of the conversation


Sorrow,

      the hardest thing
