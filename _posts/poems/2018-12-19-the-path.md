#### The Path


Where am i going?

      Everyway look's very strange and unknown


This wasn't so when i started my journey,

     Things were so clear and dreams rejuvenated


Everything i did,

       was somehow connected to my dreams


Would feel good and happy doing the things

     i loved


It's not the case now,


     Frustration is killing the life out of me


Promises are falling over like rain


     Everything i do, makes no sense at all


Regrets are filling, like droplets in the ocean


       Dreams which i once thought reachable, now seem utterly impossible


Thinking about the things i've missed,

       i regret why did i ever do such things
