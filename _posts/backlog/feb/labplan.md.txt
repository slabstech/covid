it is nice to read, that you are motivated. Dymtro and I will supervise the Challenge 3 simulation in the project group.

Do you have experience with ROS, C++, PCL and maybe Blender?

By the time the project group starts you'll get a plan what is expected from you.
Depending on how it goes, we will see together how to proceed.


Coloborate with Dan and Dmitro
