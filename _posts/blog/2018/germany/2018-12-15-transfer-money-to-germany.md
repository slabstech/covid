There are multiple ways to transfer money to your account in Germany.

Once you have created your account in Fintiba. They will provide bank account details.

your money will be deposited to Sutor Bank and you will receive 715 euros every month for 1 year


Most Indian banks charge a lot of commission.  Axis was charging nearly Rs. 3 extra. I would have paid Rs.25000 as service charge .

Two options are available, that i have used

1. TransferWise  - [Link](https://transferwise.com/u/sachins255)
2. Bookmyforex  - [Link](https://www.bookmyforex.com/?u=SACHIztU8fA)



Its better to use TransferWise as you will also get Visa Debit card when u arrive in germnany.

Bookmyforex is good, if u have an existing Axis bank account .
