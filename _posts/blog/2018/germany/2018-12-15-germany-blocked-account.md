For german visa interview.
Blocked amount of 8640 euros should be deposited in a bank .

The options available are
- Fintiba
- Deutsche bank
- Kotak Mahindra


The best option is through Fintiba because
- All process are online
- No need to send any documents to Germany
- Has english website and mobile app. Can check all status
- Response will be within 2 days

Deutsche Bank is another option
- Good option if you know  German already.
- Have to send mail to germany and they will take nearly 15 days to respond
- Use this if you have lot of time

Kotak Mahindra
- Please do not use this .
- Their charges are hidden
- Their service is pathetic
- Use this, if you have a lot of time and money to waste


Fintiba and Deustsche both charge 150 euro for one year of blocked Account

Fintiba deducts initially 90 euros and then 5 euros for next 12 months

Deustsche Bank deducts 150 initially
