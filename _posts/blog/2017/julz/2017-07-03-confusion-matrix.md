Its like this now, 2 open paths for me to pursue my further education
1. Computer Vision
2. Space Science

There are similarities between them, the learning/knowledge that's gleaned from computer vision can be applied to space observations.

The pressing matter now is , how should i proceed further. Its completely eating up brain processing. The present gig of RA is like a vast ocean , should focus priorities and jump right in. No looking back now. Two months of one year off shoot is already over.
