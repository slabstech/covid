Flyer from the event

"The expertise, ideas, experience and contacts that migrants being with them can help their countries of origin to meet the challenges of the future".
The Center for International Migration and Development (CIM) is jointly run by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and the International Placement Services (ZAV) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA).
CIM / GIZ Programme Migration for Development (PMD) facilitates knowledge exchange/transfer from India to Germany through migrants. In this session, speakers from CIM would like to inform Indian expats about their work and encourage them to contribute towards sustainable development of their home country. The programme has a new component on Diaspora experts, wherein working professionals can go back to their home country to engage in a voluntary assignment with a local organisation. To know more please be a part of the event!
