Where did all these AI companies come from ?

Do we require AI to sort dustbins

Switch off the Light

Stop Water Tap

Roomba to clean room

Yes, this is required for critically ill human beings.

But seriously, With the advent of smart tech

Humans are becoming so dumb and careless

That they cannot switch off the light

That they cannot close the tap

That they cannot clean their room

FYI, these things will reduce ur life by 10-20 years due to the
couch potato syndrome .
