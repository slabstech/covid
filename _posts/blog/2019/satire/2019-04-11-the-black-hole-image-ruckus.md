It has been quite a spectacle this week.

So many people seem to have witnessed the image of a black hole.

There was something fishy, because it looked similar to the one shown in the Stephen Hawking Biopic : The Theory of Everything.

When hawking comes extremely close to a burning ember, he sees(visualizes) radiation escaping from a black hole.

This led to hawking disproving his own doctoral dissertation.

Now how can we see image of a black hole, an event that happened light years ago .

Its not the actual image, it was computer generated image .

This age of instant aggregation will lead to easily manipulated dumb people

Read the actual story below :

3 years ago MIT grad student Katie Bouman led the creation of a new algorithm to produce the first-ever image of a black hole.
