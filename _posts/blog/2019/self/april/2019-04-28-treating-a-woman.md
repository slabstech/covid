I say something and do the complete opposite

I have been subconsciously treating woman bad

Now that i need to put the blame on someone else

And not take full responsibility as an Adult

It must have been the way i saw things growing up

Women were treated as second class citizens

Always to serve the male's

I guess, i have been doing that too

I think that i am always right

And then trying to force my ideas on the people i know

I should start observing things from their perspective

There is still hope left

But i now the writing on the wall

This life is going to be solo
