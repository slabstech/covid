It has been gross negligence on studies from my part, i've taken a lot of liberties, trying out new things.
But sort of neglecting and failing on primary goal. I have to step it up today, today also marks the flight from blore.

I had stated one purpose alone before coming here to Uni Bonn & that is to achieve summa cum laude in my studies.

I will start again anew, will optimise my time & do the needful.

The devil is in the details, should get to know the pure basics of the world now.
