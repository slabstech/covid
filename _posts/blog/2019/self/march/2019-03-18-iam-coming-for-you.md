To the ones

All those years ago

Who took screenshots of my conversations with my friends

And then shared with others

I dare you

I double dare you

Share the good stuff now

Make others do good

"If you cannot do good, dont do bad"
Mahatma Gandhi

I know you are reading,

Remember this,

I can forgive you, if you donate for a good cause

Otherwise

I am coming for you
