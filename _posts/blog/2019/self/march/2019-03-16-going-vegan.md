No matter what i did

No matter how much i donated

Guilt was always there in the subconscious for eating meat

Ethically the door was forcefully shut for pleasures of taste

For someone like me, who used to have non-veg food every alternate day

Giving it up for month in feb 2019, released  an unknown power

That guilt conscious made way for a powerful force of integrity

For i cannot talk about humanity and simultaneously gobble meat like an animal

4th Day of Going Vegan

Aloo never tasted this better before
