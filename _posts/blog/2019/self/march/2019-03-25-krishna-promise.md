Krishna had promised the mother of the tyrant that he will listen only 100 insults

No wonder the tyrant, got emboldened that he can insult Krishna with words

When the tyrant spoke the 101th insult during the failed harassment of draupadi in the Mahabharatha

Krishna's Sudharsh chakra made a clean cut of the tyrant and his head flew away

Remember there is some taking a log of all the activites
and when the day of reckoning comes.

The ML algorithm will predict

if you either enter the gates of heaven like dharmaraya

or

be punished without remorse in Dante's Inferno
