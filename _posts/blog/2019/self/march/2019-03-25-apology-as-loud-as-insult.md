Its been a week since the first warning.

You all took advantage of my naivety and had your share of laughs.

Karma is a full cycle .

Now its my turn to watch the buildings crumble down

If only u'll had forwarded the PDF as bcc.

Unfortunately i have the entire mailchain,

Going to report today to the cybercrime department as cyber harassment.

Let the law take its course. There will be collateral damage, But i do not care anyways. I gave ample time for you all to balance the scale of karma

Now your names will be added to list of criminals, U should know by now that crimes against woman are more severe.

As someone great said.

Your apology should be as loud as the insult

Vengeance is a dish best served cold
