All luck seems to have run out

The pots of Karma finally seem to revolt the abuse

All the other doors have been closed,

Only the door that one hid to divert from actual path is open

Only one way beckons now, the reason why one started

It seems alien, ambiguous and confusing after eons of neglect

But there is always the way out,

If one seeks it in Earnest
