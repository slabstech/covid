Its not Late,

To start again,

Starting at the Bottom

One has to climb & pass all the gates

To grow in life

There will be mistakes

Some self-inflicted, some brought by the wind

But stopping with inaction & praying for mercy

Can never be a final solution

Dust off the lethargy

Believe in your self, that discipline

Will take oneself forward

Do whatever it takes, to reach for the sky
