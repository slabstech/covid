The thought of what could have been,

Would be a torment even after years of passage

One needs to keep looking forward,

Move ahead after shedding old skin

The battle scars are inevitable,

Learn and avoid the perils of early pilgrim's

The same fate shall befall for taking similar actions

Keep the foot forward, one step at a time

Looking back, it seems a long away from the start,

A long ride has been ensued

From the point of no return
