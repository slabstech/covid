There are days when you feel invincible

Then some days when things dont seem to work out accordingly

If you think, you can overcome a pain,  you will definitely get over it soon enough

The only essential item is being constant in progress

The roadblocks in life are necessary to grow for oneself

Difficulties do not arrive to stop you, but they arrive for

You to jump higher, Swim swifter near your milestones

Its ok to fall down in the spiral of misery, identifying the situations one brought on self

But eventually one has to finally grow up

And stand up to the Difficulties.

The early struggles are acutely necessary to overcome the initial inertia

It will all work out fine, Keep the next step forward today

Dont stop till the current predicament is overcome.
