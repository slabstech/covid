Tossed away into the tempest of the seas

Lost sight of the shore in the darkest of nights

Storm arrives to clean rust and seeped into daily vagaries of life

Hold steady, know that this will pass

The sky will clear, with the north star shining again to lead ahead

The shore's arrive in the horizon, beckoning to traverse another Adventure.
