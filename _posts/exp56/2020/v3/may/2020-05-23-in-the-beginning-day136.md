In the beginning, we are incapable of anything great

This incapability should not stop us from going ahead

At any stage in life, if you believe that something is impossible

With regular action and application of knowledge, impossible becomes possible

Take risks, believe in doing good action.

There is abundance in life for those who seek it.
