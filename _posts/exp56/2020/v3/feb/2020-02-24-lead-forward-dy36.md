Time seems to float

The race with self looks like to have reached a loop

Visiting the same start and end and repeating again

Look for the way out

For the next stop of the journey of creation

There is vast opportunities in the horizon

Lift ones head forward

Discipline will lead the way, maybe clarity can reach out on the way
