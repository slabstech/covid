Without the link to the ground,

We'd all float like a balloon with puffed air .

Listing my failures, to remind myself

that nothing comes easy, without dedication and work

Wishes and dreams end up being regrets .

Only the used up soul, body and mind at the end of life

Can reach nirvana of self contentment.
