Karma plays the long con

The wheel comes back to the lessons unlearned

Where it takes one around in circles

One from the past, finds another to finish

The gods must definitely be laughing above

Like ghosts the memories keep circling above

The dreams of Space keep ahead the time

The world is small after all,

Look up, its all there
