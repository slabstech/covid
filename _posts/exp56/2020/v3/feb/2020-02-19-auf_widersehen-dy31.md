I've played the game

long enough to know that

Who will be the one ending up with burned hands

Face down on the mud flat spread eagled

Unless one puts a complete stop to the ensuing madness

Cutting of the repeating tangent shooting at every ebb and flow

The small leak in the life boat, will sink slowly but surely

Auf Wiedersehen
