You don't wait for good things to fall in places

You don't wait for the stars to align right

You don't wait for Karma to undo life's obstacles thrown at you

You make things happen by doing good to others & yourself

You push harder, without losing sight of the stars

Guiding you towards yours goals

You create circumstances for yourself,

for karma to rid obstacles in your path

By letting you cross safely with one's own skills

Whatever you dream, Whatever you wish

Its all possible in this lifetime
