Some ideas need time to incubate

Constantly being refined to mend the sharp edges

Most defer the ideas, if it doesn't stand the thinking of the time

Same as ideas, plans and stories need to be carefully groomed
with attention to detail

The transfer of energy from a hobby to full-time 

Progression takes years at a time,

Building enough traction & network for ideas to spread
