The depths of One Character

Greatly tested during uncertain Times

There is a cycle in Anything and Everything

Upside growth brings joy, Downfall brings gloom

The irony is that Joy and Gloom are complementary and dependent

One cannot experience gloom without joy and the other way around

The futility of life compounds by staring at a closed door,

Expecting and hoping for little light in darkness

Doors and windows are ephemeral popping up somewhere along the journey

Future gets tangled in countless way, untangling its mysteries to the seeker without fear and baggage
