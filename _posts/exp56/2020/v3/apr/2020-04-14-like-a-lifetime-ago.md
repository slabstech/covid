seems like a lifetime ago.

The small things

That we took for granted now becomes unavailable

The ones we looked down, now keep vigil everywhere

The ones who we dint want to see and show to the world

Now are the ones saving the world

Its a tightrope, one misstep brings down the castle of glass

But each forward step, helps to create wonders for the world
