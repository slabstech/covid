In the pursuit of Happiness

Where does the hurry lead to

What does excessive splurging amount to

How does exclusiveness of luxury save from hoarding

Do we have a destination, that we seem to be hurtling around

The abundance that we seem fondly attracted to

Everything needed in multiples of possessions

Somehow it comes back to let us go slow
