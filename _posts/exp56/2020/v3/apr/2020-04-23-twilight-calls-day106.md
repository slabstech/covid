There is a hidden resolve,

Only few access it completely through trials

When the path becomes clear, separating the wishes

from the daily needs to compensate society

It becomes easy, when you take a step

Without getting overwhelmed by the sight

Of the mountain ahead to climb

The more you dare & try

The more chances of getting the perfect roll of the dice

When pursuit of milestones, keeps you running from

Twilight to Twilight, that is when the call is heard
