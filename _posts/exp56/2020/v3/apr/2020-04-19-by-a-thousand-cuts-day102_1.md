Never give up anything easily

Fight with all your might and heart

For the things once lost will never return back

No matter what one does to repent

It will become but a fading memory

Than a beautiful present that one wanted

Losing someone you love, by means of inaction and ineptitude

Will haunt forever, the wound flaring up regularly

Never willing to heal up

The cries of the heart, keeps one awake at night and

In mourning during the day
