Like the Rabbit

Snoozing and wayward direction

Track doesn't seem to go ahead

Remove lethargy and move for the kill

Build the platform , one day at a time

Without toil, not even sandcastles can be built

focus only on a few things, towards the light

Than a sail-less boat tossed at the mercy of life
