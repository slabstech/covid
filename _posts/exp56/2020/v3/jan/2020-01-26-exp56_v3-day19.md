There are long days of inactivity

Longer nights of silence and stillness

The cold gets into the bones, slowing things around

Doubts and failures start to blind the front-view

Look ahead, try to keep the oil burning

There will be harder days ahead, barely able to survive

But move ahead, one step at a time

Pick up the fallen pieces, Let of past burdens

The treachery of others, the thoughts of vengeance will

Only pull you back down,

Do what you wish once in a while, not everyday can be paradise

Stop

And Restart
