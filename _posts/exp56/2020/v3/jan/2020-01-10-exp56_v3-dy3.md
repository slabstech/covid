Focus on the end goal,

Get Clear knowledge,

Narrow down the priorities

Say no to everything not urgent

Grow higher, let your dreams take you forward,

than your memories imprisoning you forever.

PS:
There will be difficult times,

I will overcome them with work and determination.

My lofty goals and minutae plans is in the right direction .

I know where i need to go, Now i need to double down on execution and stop losing flow
