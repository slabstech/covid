Today, i am happy. I am able to understand how the life around me revolves.

I know, what is my circle of influence. Patience, Belief in self and constant daily improvements are the ingredients for an amazing life to unfold.

The last 9 months, have been daily life lessons, i have seen and witnessesd the importance of having clear thoughts & working on all aspects of life.

A healthy body begets a healthy mind, with small rides on the cycle, i am keeping my body in fit condition, this inturn is helping me to have strong actions of mind.

Next countdown, would begin on Oct 31,2019 & culminate on Nov 9, 2019.

I wish & plan to do 10 new things in this timeframe & provide an update of previous countdown work.

One Life, make it count.
