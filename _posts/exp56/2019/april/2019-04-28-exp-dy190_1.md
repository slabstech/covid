Calling a Spade, a Spade

Voluntarily taking the heat for being the bad person

It was pre-ordained maybe

That it will be a solo journey

With guest chapters along the way

It wouldn't matter anyways, for crying out loud

We are but a speck of star dust

In this pale blue dot

But this star, gonna shine brightest
