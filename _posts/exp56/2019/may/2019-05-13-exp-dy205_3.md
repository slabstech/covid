Something died inside ,

When the very person,

You took the extra mile,

Tells that you are the source of all evil,

You made sure that everything important was taken care of ,

Tells that you are the reason for all misery

You took the heat from others

Tells that you are unsympathetic, creep, dangerous to be around

You, You, You are the one who doesn't bat an eyelid picking up the broken glass

But when everything fails, fingers are easily shown your way

This is deja-vu, so many times , history repeats itself

When things are valued, more than another person,

its time for houdini again
