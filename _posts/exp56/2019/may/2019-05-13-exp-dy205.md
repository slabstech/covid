Giving into temptations,

Scared i will ...

But when

Doors shut on your face

Every time one ventures out

Letting go of

All hurts, Insults, Names

But when its broken into a million pieces

Some get away

To find that one, that will

Make things whole again

Alas, there is only one outcome

Banging  the head, against the wall
