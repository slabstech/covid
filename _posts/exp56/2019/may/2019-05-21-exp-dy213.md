It was a long time coming

Dodging the bullet

Hiding behind things can go only a short while

When the boulder

Comes rolling

Decimation / Transformation

Miranda Gets Handed

For 4 counts of misdemeanour

"Books, Letters, Portfolio, Window Graffiti"

You have the right to remain silent

But when your as guilty

As the Sun Shining

Time to pick up the broken glass

Fuse it slowly again

For

Another day

Another battle

I'm inevitable
