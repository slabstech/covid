Towards left side of Bonn bridge

* The ferry transporting legs, 2 wheels, 4 wheels across the banks of Rhine
* The ducks and kids playing and ferry docking all the same place
* The cycle trail zigzagging the outskirts of bonn
* Finding the book in the library
* Locating the bridge again to show the way home
