##### When Nothing is Everything

- Removed all the items that were in my vicinity and field of vision
- All the items that would be used later, are not pushed into the cupboards. A place for Everything
- My vision in the morning, when i wake up are the 4 whitewashed walls. A clean slate for me to build my day
- My vision at the end of the days. Is a again the clean white walls. All the work to be done for the day completed to the
best of my faculties. A clean and clear mind to have a good night sleep to start a wonderful beginning tomorrow .
