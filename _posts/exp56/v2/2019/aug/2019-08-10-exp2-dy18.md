I came here with a vision

To be better, smarter than all what i did before

Will has been slowly been nudging towards

The One,

Great dream,

that keeps me awake,

that reminds me when i see around

Master pieces, put over by men of vision

In search of water,

following the myriad tributaries

finally the source is visible

The distant mountains,

high up in the sky, waiting to be

felt, seeing the view from the mountaintop

Its time for

Moonshot
