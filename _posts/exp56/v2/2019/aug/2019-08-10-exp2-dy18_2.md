Tranquillity in the chaos of distractions

Does one take the low hanging fruit

Does one aim for the moonshot,

Here at dusk,

Waiting for the Moonlight

To shine some of its moondust

.... a dreamy soul,

the rabbit one always sees

In the brightest of moments,

In the darkest of despair,

Its time to delve deep into the ever waiting adventure

Like ...., time to go in search of the

Rabbit,

On the Moon
