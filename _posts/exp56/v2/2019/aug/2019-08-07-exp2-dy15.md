Storm Comes

Every Now and Then

Not to break one down

Or to Add Misery

Only to see how Strong

One has become

Have the prior lessons learnt

Did one grow spiritually, physically

How strong is the sail (Will) stitched,

Let the Storm Arrive

I will show

I can No Longer

Be Broken

I have learnt

I am Strong

I am the Storm
