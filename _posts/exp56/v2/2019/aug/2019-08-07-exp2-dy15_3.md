Better this way

Stranger Ahead

Like we started

Strangers in the Night

A hurried smile

for the unexpected sight

Than hurting in a lost cause

So Near, Yet miles apart

A Chance encounter

Memorable, One for the happy archives

Ahead, We go

Like Rails always separated in parallel

But meeting somewhere

In the Distant Horizon

for the teary eyed eyes
