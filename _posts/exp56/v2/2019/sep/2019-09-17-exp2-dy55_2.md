An uphill climb from birth

Can't afford to slip up and fail

Live up to somebody else's expectations

Ever wonder,

Is this life ?

Why do anything ?


--------

What's the purpose of errands ?

Does wealth mean anything,
without a moments peace

Some get lucky, some start rough
 Does God play dice ?

Is everything really random ,
Are we just pawns in game of chess

Shuffling to commands of strong pieces ?

---------------

Ask yourself why ?

Coz there are  7 billion different ways to live

But is there something to live for ?

In a dog eat dog world,
Where does the moral compass point ?
