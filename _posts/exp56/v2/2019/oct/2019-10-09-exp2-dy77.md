As i Look back,

I see a lot of missed opportunities

For careless stubbornly became a motto of living

Everything became a secondary existence

Such is the current state of life

The ground below, like quick sand, devouring anything in its path

Today, one has to decide

Continue this, undirected walking or

Ideals and priorities, for the next 10 years

Shall be mightily linked to what

I do today and everyday

for the remainder of life,

till the last breath
