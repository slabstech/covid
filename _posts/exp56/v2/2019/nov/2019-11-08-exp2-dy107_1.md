Would this be a fools errand,

whose lights has been blinded by

Inactivity and false pretences

Would seeking for meaning become

an Exercise in Vain

does living ? does life

have a word , Are we destined

to spend it out like the ones

before us.

build something, for the next in line

at least , they will start a bit closer than I

Or will they become distant with

Nothing in sight
