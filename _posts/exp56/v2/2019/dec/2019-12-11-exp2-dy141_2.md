What new things are you,

learning everyday.

Everyday a new word + topic for growth

There is a mountain to climb,

but only taking each step at a time

will reach the determined goal

Do not give up,

Despair for a while, if necessary

Don't be sloppy, learn and behold, hope for the best

Don't slack
