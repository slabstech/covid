Ex1.
Expect and demand higher wages for employment.
But
Use and promote pirated tools

Ex. 2
Speak highly and good things of self
But
Automatically start criticism for others

Ex 3.
Need all duties and rights
But
Go on tour during Voting day
But
Won't help in community building

Ex. 4
Identity issues at every opportunity
Criticise the smallest of actions
But
Won't be part of solution,  
Doesn't want the solution?

Ex 5
Need roads, jobs,  hospitals
But
NIMBY
Not in my background
Affects current life style

Ex 6
Ready with pens and forks in an instant
But
Won't pick up that wrapper on the way

Ex 7
Preach against Economic inequality
But
eat at Michelin starred restaurants,  wear the latest haute couture
But
haggle with the
Low margin vegetable vendor,
Travel in subsidised trains,
Use benefits designed to reduce the gap
