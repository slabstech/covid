Machine Learning aka Artificial Intelligence aka Matrix Multiplication aka Statistics aka Linear Regression

All efforts to build a AGI - Artificial General Intelligence,
which will learn on its own.

Like Stephen Hawking, went back to beginning of creation -The Big Bang to show that even black holes release radiation.

The machines are learning from older texts and languages,
now Sanksrit and Vedas are the oldest available language and text.

If anyone is doing ML research, start building models on Sanskrit as base language, as with few modifications it can read from a larger corpus of text from derived languages to learn.
