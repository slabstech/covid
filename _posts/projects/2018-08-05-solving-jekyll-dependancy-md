Jekyll theme installation is having few installation issues.
1. bundle install fails with 'ffi' gem : fixed by installing ruby-dev -> sudo apt install ruby-dev && gem install ffi -v '1.9.25'
2. bundle install fails with rb-inotify : fixed by installing gem seperately. -> gem install rb-inotify -v '0.9.10'
3. jekyll-watch error fixed with :  bundle update jekyll-watch
4. bundle update jekyll
5. bundle update jekyll-feed
4. Need to go back to original theme and merge any latest changes.
